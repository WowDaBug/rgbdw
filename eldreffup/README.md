A Wordle Clone Based on Stardew Valley Fishing

# Description
Trying to guess what fish I'm currently reeling in based on its difficulty is a core part of my Stardew Valley fishing experience, so turning it into Wordle felt like a natural progression.

You can try it at https://pufferdle.com/

• Catch a fish and then guess what you caught based off of the difficulty you experienced.

• Use the fish's seasons, weather, location, and time to narrow down your guess, in a Wordle format.

• Practice catching any fish you want as much as you want without having to go to the location in game and reeling it in the Fish Tank. (Free practice for the Legend!)

Thanks to ConcernedApe for making the fishing mini game which is probably my favorite part of Stardew Valley (and because every asset in this was made by and belongs to him, including the code for the mini game itself which I copied into JavaScript for an identical experience.)

# Tools
This website was built in React using create-react-app.

The only other thing of note was using [MainLoop.js](https://github.com/IceCreamYou/MainLoop.js/) for the fishing minigame game loop.
